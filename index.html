        <h2 class="with-number">Take Care of Your Body</h2>
      </div>
      <p>Your physical health has a big impact on your happiness. Here are some simple ways to stay healthy:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Eat nutritious food</span> â€“ A balanced diet with fruits, vegetables, protein, and whole grains gives your body energy. Teens should aim for 5 servings of fruits and vegetables daily.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Get enough sleep</span> â€“ Teenagers need around 8-10 hours of sleep each night to stay focused and energized. Adequate sleep improves academic performance and mood regulation.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Exercise regularly</span> â€“ Whether it's sports, dancing, or just walking, movement helps you feel good and stay strong. Aim for at least 60 minutes of physical activity each day.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Stay hydrated</span> â€“ Drinking enough water helps your body function properly and keeps your mind sharp. Even mild dehydration can affect concentration and energy levels.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <div class="tip-box">
        <div class="tip-title">Tip</div>
        <p>Keep a water bottle with you throughout the day to stay hydrated. Adding fresh fruit slices like lemon or strawberry can make drinking water more enjoyable!</p>

      <p>Mental health is just as important as physical health. Here's how you can support your emotional well-being:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Manage stress</span> â€“ Find ways to relax, like listening to music, drawing, or deep breathing. Teens who practice stress management techniques report higher levels of well-being.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Talk about your feelings</span> â€“ Sharing your thoughts with a friend, family member, or counselor can help you feel supported. Open communication is important for teen mental health.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Limit screen time</span> â€“ Too much time on social media can make you feel anxious. Take breaks and enjoy real-life activities. Teens who take regular breaks from social media report less anxiety and better sleep.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Practice gratitude</span> â€“ Focusing on the good things in your life can help you feel happier. Gratitude practices can significantly improve mental health outcomes in adolescents.</li>

        <li><span class="highlight">Be kind to others</span> â€“ Helping someone or showing kindness can make both you and them feel good. Acts of kindness trigger the release of endorphins, creating what's known as a "helper's high".</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Set boundaries</span> â€“ Protect your mental health by avoiding toxic relationships and saying no when needed. Learning to set healthy boundaries is a key life skill for emotional well-being.</li>
